# Chingu Voyage Pre-work Solo Project (Tier 1): Tickybot Clone ðŸ¤–

![TickyBot Page](https://dzwonsemrish7.cloudfront.net/items/0m0c071w3T3H2w0g2714/Image%202019-08-23%20at%2010.24.47%20PM.png)

## Overview
This project provides you with great practice for making a modern looking webpage by cloning the [TickyBot Page](https://tickybott.herokuapp.com/) using **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript**.

When you are done, you will be ready to take on your own projects creating similar webpages. It is almost sure that you have seen a layout like the TickyBot's before. Many organizations such as restaurants, designers and even web developers design their own static or portfolio websites with an almost identical structure.

You could make different versions to use in future web apps you develop! ðŸš€

## Instructions

For this project you MUST use **vanilla** (plain) HTML/CSS and JavaScript. You are encouraged to use CSS grid, flexbox, media queries, a naming system like BEM, semantic HTML tags, or other modern techniques. You may not use frameworks or libraries such as Bootstrap.

General instructions for all Pre-Work Projects are located in the Chingu Voyage Handbook (URL posted in the `#read-me-first` channel on Discord). For detailed requirements checkout the ZenHub Board that is part of this repo.

To see the ZenHub tab on this GitHub repo webpage requires that you install ZenHub's browser extension. For more information visit the [ZenHub Browser Extension page](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) and these [installation instructions](https://t.ly/3v8w).

If you would like to add these tasks to your repo so you can track the progress of your Solo Project and so they will be more readily available for reference, you will need to manually add new issues to your ZenHub board and copy/paste the text in our issues to yours.

### Cloning A Website

Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to the template. Fonts, colors, and images are not important. The layout of the web page on the other hand should be the same. A suggestion would be to compare the way the template looks face to face to the clone.

And no, you don't have to re-create the TickyBot animation if you don't feel ready :) If you want, use this opportunity to get creative and come up with something of your own for that space.

Good luck!!!
