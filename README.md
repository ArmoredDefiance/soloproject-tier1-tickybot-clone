# Chingu Voyage Pre-work Solo Project (Tier 1): Tickybot Clone ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This project provides you with great practice for making a modern looking webpage by cloning the TickyBot website using **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript**.

When you are done, you will be ready to take on your own projects creating similar webpages. It is almost sure that you have seen a layout like the TickyBot's before. Many organizations such as restaurants, designers and even web developers design their own static or portfolio websites with an almost identical structure.

You could make different versions to use in future web apps you develop! ðŸš€

## Instructions
Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to the template. Fonts, colors, and images are not important. The layout of the web page on the other hand should be the same. A suggestion would be to compare the way the template looks face to face to the clone.

And no, you don't have to re-create the TickyBot animation if you don't feel ready :) If you want, use this opportunity to get creative and come up with something of your own for that space.
